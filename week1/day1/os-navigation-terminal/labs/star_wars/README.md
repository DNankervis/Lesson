# Episode 4: A New Terminal

A long time ago in a Unix environment far, far away, young Jedi padawans who knew only of desktop software were seduced by the dark side of the Force to enter: The Terminal.

## Terminal Commands

- `pwd`: List the full path to the working directory.
- `cd <directory_path>`: Change directories.
  - `cd ~/` : Go to the user directory.
  - `cd ../` : Go up one directory.
- `ls -l <directory_path>`: List the visible files in a directory.
  - `ls -la <directory_path>`: List ALL files in a directory.
- `mv <filepath> <new_filepath>`: Move/rename files.
- `mkdir <directory_name>`: Make a new directory.
- `rmdir <directory_name>`: Remove an empty directory.
- `touch <filepath>`: Create a new empty file.
- `rm <filepath>`: Remove a file.
  - `rm -r`: Remove all files in a directory.
  - `rm -rf`: Forcibly remove a directory and all of its files.
